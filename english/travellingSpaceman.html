                            The ZZ1 end-of-year project (first year of ISIMA) lasted two weeks. During the first week, our task was to work on the "Traveling Salesman Problem."
                            We created a graphical interface that allowed players to interact with a graph, and they had to propose a solution to find the shortest path to visit all cities in the graph exactly once.
                            Then, we implemented optimization algorithms to find the best possible solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second week brought a new challenge: creating an arcade game. But that wasn't all! We also had to implement an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of learning the rules of our game.
                            This meant that the AI had to improve gradually by playing and analyzing the results to become more and more competent over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the game in the second week, we decided to take inspiration from the Traveling Salesman Problem and add an original touch.
                            We replaced the graph nodes with planets, and to add an arcade aspect, we integrated asteroid fields on the sides to create walls that delimit the game space.
                            The goal of the game was to pilot a spaceship that had to visit all planets and return to the starting planet as quickly as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The spaceship moved using coordinates and had inertia, which meant that when we released the key, it continued to move a short distance before slowing down.
                            The rebounds against the walls added a maneuverability aspect to consider in order to skillfully navigate through the asteroid field and planets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To increase the difficulty and make the game even more captivating, we introduced black holes.
                            These black holes had an attractive effect on the spaceship, causing it to deviate from its normal trajectory.
                            If the spaceship was too close to a black hole and got sucked in by its gravitational force, the player lost the game.
                            This required great skill and responsiveness to avoid traps and achieve the best possible time while exploring space travel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These two weeks were rich in learning and exciting challenges.
                            We were able to explore advanced programming concepts, develop interactive interfaces, and implement optimization strategies to solve complex problems.
                            Moreover, creating an AI capable of learning was a captivating experience that allowed us to discover the world of artificial intelligence and its playful applications.
                            This project was an exceptional opportunity to put our knowledge into practice and develop our programming and game design skills.
