                        <p>
                            During the virtual reality course at Prepa'ISIMA 2, we learned to use the Processing language,
                            which is a graphical programming environment for creating interactive and visual applications.
                            So, I wanted to start a project with this language, and one of my projects was to develop a game inspired by the famous game Minecraft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this "Minecraft-like" project, I implemented a feature that allows the user to interact with the virtual world by placing and destroying blocks.
                            This interaction is performed using simple actions such as mouse clicks to place a block at the desired location or to destroy an existing block.
                            This gives an immersive dimension to the game, allowing the player to shape the world according to their wishes by creating or modifying the environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, an interesting part of this project was optimizing the game's performance.
                            With an infinite map and procedural generation of "chunks," it is essential to efficiently manage resources to avoid overload and ensure a smooth user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, I implemented optimization techniques, including dynamic loading and unloading of "chunks" based on their position relative to the player's field of view.
                            "Chunks" located outside the field of view can be unloaded from memory to save resources, while new "chunks" visible to the player are loaded on the fly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I applied optimization methods for blocks that are not visible on the screen.
                            These blocks do not need to be graphically rendered, so I excluded them from the rendering process to reduce the load on the graphics engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The procedural generation of the map uses noises, which are mathematical functions that generate coherent random values in space.
                            This creates the illusion of a natural and varied terrain, creating mountains, valleys, plains, etc., in a realistic way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also implemented the generation of structures, such as trees.
                            This means that trees are automatically placed in random locations on the map, following certain rules to ensure they appear naturally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project allowed me to better understand 3D engine development, procedural generation, and manipulation of interactive objects.
                            It was an enriching and exciting experience that allowed me to deepen my development skills.
                        </p>
